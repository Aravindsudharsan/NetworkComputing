# Real-time transport protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end delivery services for data with real-time characteristics, such as interactive audio and video. 
# Those services include payload type identification, sequence numbering, timestamping and delivery monitoring. 
# Applications typically run RTP on top of UDP to make use of its multiplexing and checksum services and both protocols contribute parts of the transport protocol functionality. 
# RTP supports data transfer to multiple destinations through multicast distribution

# The code.py file takes .pcapng file as input and calculates the delay and packet loss for specific port numbers
# It calculates the delay and packet loss for 3 applications namely Facebook, Google Hangouts and Skype
